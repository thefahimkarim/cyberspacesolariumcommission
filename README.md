This was a project I did to show my cyber policy class at the School of Public Affairs at American University.
As a guest speaker, I showed them how I could do text mining and NLP of large documents and they could do the same using RStudio and its packages.
The results were visualized.
Those visualizations will help senior executives and stakeholders understand the document(s) quicker and in-depth. This will help them to make decisions more diligently.
